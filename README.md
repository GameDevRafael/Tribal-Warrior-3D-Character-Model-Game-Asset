# Low-Poly Humanoid Character 3D Asset

## Overview

This project showcases a **game-ready 3D model low-poly humanoid character in Blender**, developed entirely by me for a future game project.  
This character is ready to be imported into Unity, featuring an **ancient warrior-like appearance** with a shirtless torso, leather boots/accessories, and metal bracelets on both arms. I used advanced techniques and modifiers to achieve efficiency throughout its development.

## Asset Details

### Modeling Techniques

I used advanced techniques to balance detail and efficiency:

- **Mirror Modifier**: Ensures symmetry, with half of the character mirrored to the other half.  
- **Multiresolution Sculpting**: For detailed features like veins, muscle definition, skin texture, and realistic clothing details.  
- **Solidify Modifier**: Applied for clothing items such as a leather skirt, metal bracelets, and leather boots with pointed tips.  
- **Shrinkwrap Modifier**: Used for retopology, creating a new low-poly mesh adhering to the sculpt, followed by normal, AO and color map baking.

### Rigging and Animations

The character is fully rigged with an armature and includes animations for:  

- Walking  
- Running  
- Jumping  
- Idle motions

### Textures and Materials

Baked maps ensure a high-quality look in-game:

- **Normal Map**: Captures fine details like veins, muscle definition, and skin texture.  
- **Color/AO Map**: Provides realistic colors for skin, leather, and metal, alongside correct simulation of lighting effects.

## Use Cases

My asset is best suited for these types of games:

- **Action**: Perfect for the ancient warrior aesthetic.  
- **Fantasy**: Ideal for roles such as gladiators, mercenaries, or mythical fighters.  
- **Adventure**: A versatile character for exploration and storytelling.
